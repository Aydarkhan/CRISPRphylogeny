## Distance matrix between CRISPR-cassettes

This program is created as a part of semester project at MSU.
Given input data as CRISPR-cassette spacers it
estimates the matrix of distances between cassettes
via pairwise alignment (Needleman-Wunsch) of spacer sequences.
The distances can be further used to reconstruct the tree.

#### Requirements
Parsing of command line options is implemented
with GnuParser, so you need Commons CLI.
